# Doxyfile 1.9.4

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.

PROJECT_NAME = "libpqxx"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF = "The C++ client library for PostgreSQL"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

# Path to where to generate Doxygen output.  Defaults to working directory
# when doxygen was run.  Relative paths are relative to there.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create up to 4096
# sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format
# and will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system. Adapt CREATE_SUBDIRS_LEVEL to
# control the number of sub-directories.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# Controls the number of sub-directories that will be created when
# CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES. Level 0 represents 16 directories, and every
# level increment doubles the number of directories, resulting in 4096
# directories at level 8 which is the default and also the maximum value. The
# sub-directories are organized in 2 levels, the first level always has a fixed
# numer of 16 directories.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 8, default value: 8.
# This tag requires that the tag CREATE_SUBDIRS is set to YES.

CREATE_SUBDIRS_LEVEL   = 8

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.
#
# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

# XXX: May want to change this.
MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE = 8

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, Lex, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# VHDL, Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen. When specifying no_extension you should add
# * to the FILE_PATTERNS.
#
# Note see also the list of default file extension mappings.

# XXX: Set hxx=C++ cxx=C++?
EXTENSION_MAPPING =

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

# XXX: No idea what that description means!
BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT = NO

# If one adds a struct or class to a group and this option is enabled, then also
# any nested class or struct is added to the same group. By default this option
# is disabled and one has to add nested compounds explicitly via \ingroup.
# The default value is: NO.

GROUP_NESTED_COMPOUNDS = NO

# When the INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes, structs and unions
# are shown inside the group in which they are included (e.g. using \ingroup)
# instead of on a separate page (for HTML and Man pages) or section (for LaTeX
# and RTF).
#
# Note that this feature does not work in combination with
# SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES.
# The default value is: NO.

# XXX: Would be nice to have a group for e.g. "transaction classes."
INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES = NO

# When the INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS tag is set to YES, structs, classes, and unions
# with only public data fields or simple typedef fields will be shown inline in
# the documentation of the scope in which they are defined (i.e. file,
# namespace, or group documentation), provided this scope is documented. If set
# to NO, structs, classes, and unions are shown on a separate page (for HTML and
# Man pages) or section (for LaTeX and RTF).
# The default value is: NO.

# XXX: Probably a good thing to change.
INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS  = NO

# The NUM_PROC_THREADS specifies the number of threads doxygen is allowed to use
# during processing. When set to 0 doxygen will base this on the number of
# cores available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value larger
# than 0 to get more control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
# which effectively disables parallel processing. Please report any issues you
# encounter. Generating dot graphs in parallel is controlled by the
# DOT_NUM_THREADS setting.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 32, default value: 1.

# XXX: Change to zero.

# only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect
# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES = NO

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any

# If the SHOW_HEADERFILE tag is set to YES then the documentation for a class
# will show which file needs to be included to use the class.
# The default value is: YES.

SHOW_HEADERFILE = NO

# XXX: Revise from here.

# The FILE_VERSION_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program or script that
# doxygen should invoke to get the current version for each file (typically from
# the version control system). Doxygen will invoke the program by executing (via
# popen()) the command command input-file, where command is the value of the
# FILE_VERSION_FILTER tag, and input-file is the name of an input file provided
# by doxygen. Whatever the program writes to standard output is used as the file
# version. For an example see the documentation.

FILE_VERSION_FILTER    =

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. To create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. You can
# optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted DoxygenLayout.xml
# will be used as the name of the layout file. See also section "Changing the
# layout of pages" for information.
#
# Note that if you run doxygen from a directory containing a file called
# DoxygenLayout.xml, doxygen will parse it automatically even if the LAYOUT_FILE
# tag is left empty.

LAYOUT_FILE            =

# The CITE_BIB_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more bib files containing
# the reference definitions. This must be a list of .bib files. The .bib
# extension is automatically appended if omitted. This requires the bibtex tool
# to be installed. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX for more info.
# For LaTeX the style of the bibliography can be controlled using
# LATEX_BIB_STYLE. To use this feature you need bibtex and perl available in the
# search path. See also \cite for info how to create references.

# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.

QUIET                  = NO

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are
# generated to standard error (stderr) by doxygen. If WARNINGS is set to YES
# this implies that the warnings are on.
#
# Tip: Turn warnings on while writing the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

WARNINGS               = YES

# If the WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate

# will automatically be disabled.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = YES

# If the WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate warnings for

# a documented function twice, or documenting parameters that don't exist or
# using markup commands wrongly.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR      = YES

# If WARN_IF_INCOMPLETE_DOC is set to YES, doxygen will warn about incomplete
# function parameter documentation. If set to NO, doxygen will accept that some
# parameters have no documentation without warning.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_INCOMPLETE_DOC = YES

# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for functions that
# are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters or return
# value. If set to NO, doxygen will only warn about wrong parameter
# documentation, but not about the absence of documentation. If EXTRACT_ALL is
# set to YES then this flag will automatically be disabled. See also
# WARN_IF_INCOMPLETE_DOC
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC       = NO

# If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to YES then doxygen will immediately stop when
# a warning is encountered. If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to FAIL_ON_WARNINGS
# then doxygen will continue running as if WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to NO, but
# at the end of the doxygen process doxygen will return with a non-zero status.
# Possible values are: NO, YES and FAIL_ON_WARNINGS.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_AS_ERROR          = NO

# The WARN_FORMAT tag determines the format of the warning messages that doxygen
# can produce. The string should contain the $file, $line, and $text tags, which
# will be replaced by the file and line number from which the warning originated
# and the warning text. Optionally the format may contain $version, which will
# be replaced by the version of the file (if it could be obtained via
# FILE_VERSION_FILTER)
# See also: WARN_LINE_FORMAT
# The default value is: $file:$line: $text.

WARN_FORMAT            = "$file:$line: $text"

# In the $text part of the WARN_FORMAT command it is possible that a reference
# to a more specific place is given. To make it easier to jump to this place
# (outside of doxygen) the user can define a custom "cut" / "paste" string.
# Example:
# WARN_LINE_FORMAT = "'vi $file +$line'"
# See also: WARN_FORMAT
# The default value is: at line $line of file $file.

WARN_LINE_FORMAT       = "at line $line of file $file"

# The WARN_LOGFILE tag can be used to specify a file to which warning and error
# messages should be written. If left blank the output is written to standard
# error (stderr). In case the file specified cannot be opened for writing the
# warning and error messages are written to standard error. When as file - is
# specified the warning and error messages are written to standard output
# (stdout).

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  =

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see:
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

INPUT_ENCODING         = UTF-8

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.

# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
