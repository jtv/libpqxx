# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create up to 4096
# sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format
# and will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system. Adapt CREATE_SUBDIRS_LEVEL to
# control the number of sub-directories.
# The default value is: NO.

# When the INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes, structs and unions

# and RTF).
#
# Note that this feature does not work in combination with

# The default value is: NO.

# When the INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS tag is set to YES, structs, classes, and unions
# with only public data fields or simple typedef fields will be shown inline in
# the documentation of the scope in which they are defined (i.e. file,
# namespace, or group documentation), provided this scope is documented. If set
# to NO, structs, classes, and unions are shown on a separate page (for HTML and
# Man pages) or section (for LaTeX and RTF).

# The NUM_PROC_THREADS specifies the number of threads doxygen is allowed to use
# during processing. When set to 0 doxygen will base this on the number of
# cores available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value larger
# than 0 to get more control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
# which effectively disables parallel processing. Please report any issues you
# encounter. Generating dot graphs in parallel is controlled by the
# DOT_NUM_THREADS setting.

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that

MACRO_EXPANSION = YES

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that

# RECURSIVE has no effect here.
# This tag requires that the tag SEARCH_INCLUDES is set to YES.

# If the SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS tag is set to YES then doxygen's preprocessor will

# If the CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING tag is set to YES then doxygen will use the

# http://clang.llvm.org/) for more accurate parsing at the cost of reduced
# performance. This can be particularly helpful with template rich C++ code for
# which doxygen's built-in parser lacks the necessary type information.

# If clang assisted parsing is enabled you can provide the compiler with command
# line options that you would normally use when invoking the compiler. Note that

# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a color-wheel, see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS = YES

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
# consider setting DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
