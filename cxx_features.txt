# Feature checks that we can perform simply by testing a C++ feature
# test macro, but for which we want a consistent setting between the libpqxx
# source files and headers.  This can avoid ABI inconsistencies when an
# application uses a libpqxx that was compiled with a slightly different
# compiler configuration, such as the same compiler but under a different
# version ofthe C++ language.
#
# Each (non-empty, non-comment) line consists of a libpqxx feature macro
# and the corresponding C++ feature test macro that we need to check in
# order to detect that feature.
#
# From these, the autogen script generates code snippets that the build
# configuration step can try to compile, as well as the bits of config
# to do that in the supported build systems.
#
# Remember to enter each of these in configitems as well, or they won't
# end up in the actual configuration headers.

# Example:
# PQXX_HAVE_MULTIDIM __cpp_multidimensional_subscript
