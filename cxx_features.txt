# Feature checks that we can perform simply by testing a C++ feature
# test macro.
#
# Each (non-empty, non-comment) line consists of a libpqxx feature macro
# and the corresponding C++ feature test macro that we need to check in
# order to detect that feature.
#
# From these, the autogen script generates code snippets that the build
# configuration step can try to compile, as well as the bits of config
# to do that in the supported build systems.
#
# Remember to enter each of these in configitems as well, or they won't
# end up in the actual configuration headers.
