# Common options for Visual C++ makefiles to build libpqxx and its regression
# test.
# THE ORIGINAL OF THIS FILE IS CALLED common-sample; DON'T EDIT THE ORIGINAL or
# you may lose your changes when you upgrade your libpqxx sources.
# Instead, copy "common-sample" to "common" and edit just the file "common".

# Caution: on Windows, some environments, such as the "make" that comes with
# Visual C++, expect you to use backslashes as path separators (for example,
# "C:\src\libpqxx") whereas others like MinGW want you to use more conventional
# slashes (as in "C:/src/libpqxx").

# Standard library namespace.
# There are only two reasons why you might want to change this:
#
# 1. Your compiler doesn't define the standard library in the "std" namespace
# but in the global namespace, in which case PGSTD should be the empty string.
# However, a compiler with that problem is not likely to be good enough to
# compile libpqxx.
#
# 2. You are using a third-party standard library implementation such as
# STLport, which lives in another namespace to avoid clashes with the
# implementation that came with the compiler.
#
# In the latter case, PGSTD must be set to the namespace used by your preferred
# implementation.  In all other cases, just leave this set to "std".
STD="std"

# If you are using a 3rd-party STL like STLport, remember to check your path
# and be sure the STLport is included before the MSVC includes. VCVARS32.BAT
# doesn't know anything about the directories as defined in the IDE. I use
#
# set INCLUDE=\Utility\Code\STLport-4.5\stlport;%INCLUDE%
#
# ...and set STD to "_STL".

# Depending on your STL library min/max need to be defined.  Using STLport
# there is no need for libpqxx to redefine these for me.

# The next line gives us the src directory to add additional include directories
# We need certain header files from the Postgres code.  Specifically 
#
#	postgres_ext.h (in src/include in the PostgreSQL source tree)
#	libpq-fe.h (in src/interfaces/libpq in the PostgreSQL source tree)
#
# This directory is also used to find the compiled libpq and libpqd.
PGSQLSRC="D:\Src\postgresql-8.1.3\src"

# Paths where the libpq library binary or binaries can be found.
# We should use the libpq libraries that correspond to the source tree whose
# headers we are including.  This ensures that we find all in the same place:
LIBPATH1="$(PGSQLSRC)/interfaces/libpq/Release"
LIBPATH2="$(PGSQLSRC)/interfaces/libpq/Debug"
