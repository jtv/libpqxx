libpqxx for Debian
------------------

The libpqxx source is obtained from <http://pqxx.org/download/software/libpqxx/>
or via SVN from <svn://pqxx.org/libpqxx/trunk/>
The debian packaging tracks the latest tarball from the 1st url.

Due to DSFG upstream source is cleaned by removing minified JavaScript files
without source and other incompatible code. Cleaned source has "dfsg" as
suffix. Itâ€™s handled with debian/rules get-orig-source target. Following files
has been removed from orig.tar.gz:
  * doc/html/Reference/jquery.js

The libpqxx package source is maintained in the Debian collab-maint project. You
can obtain a copy of the source (including the upstream source) from
<git://git.debian.org/git/collab-maint/libpqxx.git>

  * The 'pristine-tar' branch is used to store imported (with pristine-tar)
    tarballs
    ** If you wish you can recreate original tarball running pristine-tar
      command
    ** It's a standalone branch 
  * 'upstream' branch is where we're keeping untarred source code for libpqxx
    coming in from tarball which was loaded into pristine-tar branch
    ** It's a clean branch which is merged into master
  * The 'master' branch is a branch where we're keeping Debian package specific
    files and merging in (with --no-ff) 'upstream' branch to build packages.
    ** All Debian specific patches are stored in this branch
  * We carry upstream's tags in 'upstream' branch prefixed with 'upstream/', if
    there is no tag on revision we're using tag accordingly to following e.g:
      upstream/3.0.0.svn1419
  * We prefix our tags with 'debian/' e.g. debian/3.0.2-2
    ** experimental releases are prefixed 'debian/experimental'
     e.g. debian/experimental/4.0-1
