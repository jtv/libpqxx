libpqxx (2.5.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in:
    - Add a "c2a" suffix to the library package name, and conflict
      with the previous name.  This is for rebuilding against the

  * Retained patches from previous release:
    - include/pqxx/Makefile.am (installed headers)
    - debian/rules (delete examples using internal headers)
    - debian/control.in (version Build-Depends on postgresql-dev
      and chrpath, libpqxx-dev depends on versioned postgresql-dev
      and pkg-config).
  * Re-bootstrapped with current autotools.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 2004 12:14:11 +0000

libpqxx (2.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * libpqxx-dev:
    - Depend upon pkg-config.
    - Don't install compiler.h, which includes internal headers
      that are not installed.
    Thanks to Dennis Lubert for reporting these problems.
    -  Remove all examples that include private headers; the
       deletion rules were outdated due to header renaming.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Oct 2004 15:59:52 +0100

libpqxx (2.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't install private headers which are only for internal
    use for the duration of the build.  Only install

  * Patch configure.ac.in to work with automake-1.9 (added
    a tar-ustar option to ensure portable tarballs may be
    generated).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Sep 2004 22:38:24 +0100

libpqxx (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #265639).

libpqxx (2.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Removed deletion of include/pqxx/config.h and
    include/pqxx/libconfig.h, which are no longer distributed.
  * debian/rules: libpqxx-dev includes the regression tests as
    example code.  Some tests use the internal headers internalconfig.h
    and compiler.h.  These tests are now removed from libpqxx-dev
    (Closes: #240499).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 May 2004 14:55:23 +0100

libpqxx (2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * tools/Makefile.am: add -I$(top_builddir)/include to INCLUDES to

libpqxx (2.1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * libpqxx-dev depends upon postgresql-dev.  This should solve
    some potential build environment incompatibilities.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Mar 2004 20:41:59 +0000

libpqxx (2.1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force building with the correct version of postgresql-dev by
    Build-Depending upon postgresql-dev (>= 7.4.1-3).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Feb 2004 20:25:43 +0000

libpqxx (2.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild to fix a dependency issue due to an outdated libpq3 shlibs
    file (Bug #230259, which was reassigned to postgresql).  This
    caused run-time linker errors when used with older libpq3 versions,
    due to missing symbols only present with PostgreSQL 7.4.x.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Feb 2004 17:58:54 +0000

libpqxx (2.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

libpqxx (2.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #219389).
  * Acknowledge bugs closed by previous NMUs
    (Closes: #217203, #198441, #201263).
  * Switched to using the new library versioning scheme with
    package version string in the library DT_SONAME.  This
    requires preprocessing of debian/control, and versioned
    symlinks are created at build time.
  * Added pkg-config libpqxx.pc file.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Jan 2004 15:05:44 +0000

libpqxx (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added myself as the new maintainer of libpqxx.
  * Merge upstream Debian packaging changes:
    - 1.7.6-1: Example packaging to be used with libpqxx development version
               1.7.6 (Greg Hookey).
    - 1.9.6-1: Source changes (Jeroen T. Vermeulen).
    - 2.0.0-1: [debian/control, debian/rules] Use chrpath to get rid of RPATH
               in the shared library (J.H.M. Dassen (Ray))
  * Added the new tutorial to libpqxx-dev.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Nov 2003 21:09:06 +0000

libpqxx (1.5.1-1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Include test/*.cxx as usage examples in libpqxx-dev (Closes: #217203).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 2003 22:23:31 +0000

libpqxx (1.5.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Add API reference documentation to libpqxx-dev
    (Closes: #198441, #201263).
  * Use dh_install instead of the old dh_movefiles, to enable
    copying of the HTML documentation.
  * Use DESTDIR rather than prefix for make install, since
    overriding prefix may cause subtle breakage.
  * /usr/share/doc/libpqxx-dev may no longer be a symbolic link.
    libpqxx now has a preinst script to remove the link if it is
    detected, to prevent the documentation being incorrectly
    installed under /usr/share/doc/libpqxx0 (since dpkg follows
    symbolic links).
  * CVS directories present in the upstream tarball are removed
    in the debian/rules clean rule, to prevent inclusion in a
    binary package.
  * Fold lines over 79 columns in debian/copyright.
  * Change section of libpqxx-dev from libs to libdevel.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Sep 2003 23:49:17 +0100
