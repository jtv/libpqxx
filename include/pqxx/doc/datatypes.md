Supporting additional data types                              {#datatypes}
================================

Communication with the database mostly happens in a text format.  When you
include an integer value in a query, you use `to_string` to convert it to that
text format.  When you get a query result field "as a float," it converts from
the text format to a floating-point type.  These conversions are everywhere in
libpqxx.

The conversion sydstem supports many built-in types, but it is also extensible.
You can "teach" libpqxx (in the scope of your own application) to convert
additional types of values to and from PostgreSQL's string format.

This is massively useful, but it's not for the faint of heart.  You'll need to
specialise some templates.  And, **the API for doing this can change with any
major libpqxx release.**


Converting types
----------------

In your application, a conversion is driven entirely by a C++ type you specify.
The value's SQL type has nothing to do with it, nor is there anything in the
string that would identify its type.

So, if you've SELECTed a 64-bit integer from the database, and you try to
convert it to a C++ "short," one of two things will happen: either the number
is small enough to fit in your `short` (and it just works), or else it throws a
conversion exception.

Or, your database table might have a text column, but a given field may contain
a string that _looks_ just like a number.  You can convert that value to an
integer type just fine.  Or to a floating-point type.  All that matters to the
conversion is the actual value, and the type.

In some cases the templates for these conversions can tell the type from the
arguments you pass them:

```cxx
    auto x = to_string(99);
```

In other cases you may need to instantiate template explicitly:

```cxx
    auto y = from_string<int>("99");
```


Supporting a new type
---------------------

Let's say you have some other SQL type which you want to be able to store in,
or retrieve from, the database.  What would it take to support that?

Sometimes you do not need _complete_ support.  You might need a conversion _to_
a string but not _from_ a string, for example.  The conversion is defined at
compile time, so don't be too afraid to be incomplete.  If you leave out one of
these steps, it's not going to crash at run time or mess up your data.  The
worst that can happen is that your code won't build.

So what do you need for a complete conversion?

First off, of course, you need a C++ type.  It may be your own, but it
doesn't have to be.  It could be a type from a third-party library, or even one
from the standard library that libpqxx does not yet support.

You also specialise the `pqxx::type_name` variable to specify the type's name.
This is important for all code which mentions your type in human-readable text,
such as error messages.

Then, does your type have a built-in null value?  You specialise the
`pqxx::nullness` template to specify the details.

Finally, you specialise the `pqxx::string_traits` template.  This is where you
define the actual conversions.

Let's go through these steps one by one.


Your type
---------

You'll need a type for which the conversions are not yet defined, because the
C++ type is what determines the right conversion.  One type, one set of
conversions.

The type doesn't have to be one that you create.  The conversion logic was
designed such that you can build it around any type.  So you can just as
easily build a conversion for a type that's defined somewhere else.  There's
no need to include any special methods or other members inside it.  That's also
how libpqxx can support converting built-in types like `int`.

By the way, if the type is an enum, you don't need to do any of this.  Just
invoke the preprocessor macro `PQXX_DECLARE_ENUM_CONVERSION`, from the global
namespace near the top of your translation unit, and pass the type as an
argument.

The library also provides specialisations for `std::optional<T>`,
`std::shared_ptr<T>`, and `std::unique_ptr<T>`.  If you have conversions for
`T`, you'll also have conversions for those.


Specialise `type_name`
----------------------

When errors happen during conversion, libpqxx will compose error messages for
the user.  Sometimes these will include the name of the type that's being
converted.

To tell libpqxx the name of each type, there's a template variable called
`pqxx::type_name`.  For any given type `T`, it should have a specialisation
that provides that `T`'s human-readable name:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> std::string const type_name<T>{"T"};
    }
```

(Yes, this means that you need to define something inside the pqxx namespace.
Future versions of libpqxx may move this into a separate namespace.)

Define this early on in your translation unit, before any code that might cause
libpqxx to need the name.  That way, the libpqxx code which needs to know the
type's name can see your definition.


Specialise `nullness`
---------------------

A struct template `pqxx::nullness` defines whether your type has a natural
"null value" built in.  If so, it also provides member functions for producing
and recognising null values.

The simplest scenario is also the most common: most types don't have a null
value built in.  In that case, derive your nullness traits from
`pqxx::no_null`:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> struct nullness<T> : pqxx::no_null<T> {};
    }
```

(Here again you're defining this in the pqxx namespace.)

If your type does have a natural null value, the definition gets a little more
complex:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> struct nullness<T>
    {
      static constexpr bool has_null{true};
      static constexpr bool always_null{false};

      static bool is_null(T const &value)
      {
        // Return whether "value" is null.
        return ...;
      }

      [[nodiscard]] static T null()
      {
        // Return a null value.
        return ...;
      }
    };
    }
```

You may be wondering why there's a function to produce a null value, but also a
function to check whether a value is null.  Why not just compare the value to
the result of `null()`?  Because two null values may not be equal.  `T` may
have several different null values.  Or it may override the comparison
operator, similar to SQL where NULL is not equal to NULL.

As a third case, your type may be one that _always_ represents a null value.
This is the case for `std::nullptr_t` and `std::nullopt_t`.  In that case, you
set `nullness<TYPE>::always_null` to `true` (as well as `has_null` of course),
and you won't need to define any actual conversions.


Specialise `string_traits`
-------------------------

This part is more work.  (You can skip it for types that are _always_ null,
but those will be rare.)  Specialise the `pqxx::string_traits` template:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> struct string_traits<T>
    {
      static T from_string(std::string_view text);
      static zview to_buf(char *begin, char *end, T const &value);
      static char *into_buf(char *begin, char *end, T const &value);
      static std::size_t size_buffer(T const &value) noexcept;
    };
    }
```

You'll also need to write those member functions, or as many of them as needed
to get your code to build.


### `from_string`

We start off simple: `from_string` parses a string as a value of `T`, and
returns that value.

The string may not be zero-terminated; it's just the `string_view` from
beginning to end (exclusive).  In your tests, cover cases where the string
does not end in a zero byte.

It's perfectly possible that the string isn't actually a `T` value.  Mistakes
happen.  In that case, throw a `pqxx::conversion_error`.

(Of course it's also possible that you run into some other error, so it's fine
to throw different exceptions as well.  But when it's definitely "this is not
the right format for a `T`," throw `conversion_error`.)


### `to_buf`

In this function, you convert a value of `T` into a string that the postgres
server will understand.

The caller will provide you with a buffer where you can write the string, if
you need it: from `begin` to `end` exclusive.  It's a half-open interval, so
don't access `*end`.

If the buffer is insufficient for you to do the conversion, throw a
`pqxx::conversion_overrun`.  It doesn't have to be exact: you can be a little
pessimistic and demand a bit more space than you need.  Just be sure to throw
the exception if there's any risk of overrunning the buffer.

You don't _have_ to use the buffer for this function though.  For example,
`pqxx::string_traits<bool>::to_buf` returns a compile-time constant string and
ignores the buffer.

Even if you do use the buffer, your string does not _have_ to start at the
beginning of the buffer.  For example, the integer conversions start by writing
the _least_ significant digit to the _end_ of the buffer, and then writes the
more significant digits before it.  It was just more convenient.

Return a `pqxx::zview`.  This is basically a `std::string_view`, but with one
difference: a `zview` guarantees that there will be a valid zero byte right
after the `string_view`.  The zero byte is not counted as part of its size, but
it will be there.

Expressed in code, this rule must hold:

```cxx
    void invariant(zview z)
    {
      assert(z[std::size(z)] == 0);
    }
```

Make sure you write your trailing zero _before_ the `end`.  If the trailing
zero doesn't fit in the buffer, then there's just not enough room to perform
the conversion.

Beware of locales when converting.  If you use standard library features like
`sprintf`, they may obey whatever locale is currently set on the system.   That
means that a simple integer like 1000000 may come out as "1000000" on your
system, but as "1,000,000" on mine, or as "1.000.000" for somebody else, and on
an Indian system it may be "1,00,000".  Values coming from or going to the
database should be in non-localised formats.  You can use libpqxx functions for
those conversions: `pqxx::from_string`, `pqxx::to_string`, `pqxx::to_buf`.


### `into_buf`

This is a stricter version of `to_buf`.  All the same requirements apply, but
in addition you must write your string into the buffer provided, starting
_exactly_ at `begin`.

That's why this function returns just a simple pointer: the address right
behind the trailing zero.  If the caller wants to use the string, they can
find it at `begin`.  If they want to write a different value into the rest of
the buffer, they can start at the location you returned.


### `size_buffer`

Here you estimate how much buffer space you need for converting a `T` to a
string.  Be precise if you can, but pessimistic if you must.  It's usually
better to waste a few unnecessary bytes than to spend a lot of time computing
the exact buffer space you need.  And failing the conversion because you
under-budgeted the buffer is worst of all.

Include the trailing zero in the buffer size.  If your `to_buf` takes more
space than just what's needed to store the result, include that too.

Make `size_buffer` a `constexpr` function if you can.  It can allow the caller
to allocate the buffer on the stack, with a size known at compile time.


Optional: Specialise `is_unquoted_safe`
---------------------------------------

When converting arrays or composite values to strings, libpqxx may need to
quote values and escape any special characters.  This takes time.

Some types though, such as integral or floating-point types, can never have
any special characters such as quotes, commas, or backslashes in their string
representations.  In such cases, there's no need to quote or escape such values
in arrays or composite types.

If your type is like that, you can tell libpqxx about this by defining:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> inline constexpr bool is_unquoted_safe<MY_TYPE>{true};
    }
```

The code that converts this type of field to strings in an array or a composite
type can then use a simpler, more efficient variant of the code.  It's always
safe to leave this out; it's _just_ an optimisation for when you're completely
sure that it's safe.

Do not do this if a string representation of your type may contain a comma;
semicolon; parenthesis; brace; quote; backslash; newline; or any other
character that might need escaping.


Optional: Specialise `param_format`
-----------------------------------

This one you don't generally need to worry about.  Read on if you're writing a
type which represents raw binary data, or if you're writing a template where
_some specialisations_ may contain raw binary data.

When you call parameterised statements, or prepared statements with parameters,
libpqxx needs to your parameters on to libpq, the underlying C-level PostgreSQL
client library.

There are two formats for doing that: _text_ and _binary._  In the first, we
represent all values as strings, and the server then converts them into its own
internal binary representation.  That's what the string conversions are all
about, and it's what we do for almost all types of parameters.

But we do it differently when the parameter is a contiguous series of raw bytes
and the corresponding SQL type is `BYTEA`.  There is a text format for those,
but we bypass it for efficiency.  The server can use the binary data in the
exact same form, without any conversion or extra processing.  The binary data
is also twice as compact during transport.

(People sometimes ask why we can't just treat all types as binary.  However the
general case isn't so clear-cut.  The binary formats are not documented, there
are no guarantees that they will be platform-independent or that they will
remain stable, and there's no really solid way to detect when we might get the
format wrong.  But also, the conversions aren't necessarily as straightforward
and efficient as they sound.  So, for the general case, libpqxx sticks with the
text formats.  Raw binary data alone stands out as a clear win.)

Long story short, the machinery for passing parameters needs to know: is this
parameter a binary string, or not?  In the normal case it can assume "no," and
that's what it does.  The text format is always a safe choice; we just try to
use the binary format where it's faster.

The `param_format` function template is what makes the decision.  We specialise
it for types which may be binary strings, and use the default for all other
types.

"Types which _may_ be binary"?  You might think we know whether a type is a
binary type or not.  But there are some complications with generic types.

Templates like `std::shared_ptr`, `std::optional`, and so on act like
"wrappers" for another type.  A `std::optional<T>` is binary if `T` is binary.
Otherwise, it's not.  If you're building support for a template of this nature,
you'll probably want to implement `param_format` for it.

The decision to use binary format is made based on a given object, not
necessarily based on the type in general.  Look at `std::variant`.  If you have
a `std::variant` type which can hold an `int` or a binary string, is that a
binary parameter?  We can't decide without knowing the individual object.

Containers are another hard case.  Should we pass `std::vector<T>` in binary?
Even when `T` is a binary type, we don't currently have any way to pass an
array in binary format, so we always pass it as text.
