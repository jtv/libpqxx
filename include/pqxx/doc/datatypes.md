Supporting additional data types                              {#datatypes}
================================

Communication with the database mostly happens in a text format.  When you
include an integer value in a query, either you use `to_string` to convert it
to that text format, or you pass it as a paraemeter and libpqxx does it for you
under the bonnet.  When you get a query result field "as a float," libpqxx
converts from the text format to a floating-point type.  These conversions are
everywhere in libpqxx.

The conversion system supports many built-in types, but it is also extensible.
You can "teach" libpqxx (in the scope of your own application) to convert
additional types of values to and from PostgreSQL's string format.

This is massively useful, but it's not for the faint of heart.  You'll need to
specialise several templates.  And, **the API for doing this can change with
any major libpqxx release.**

If that happens, your code may fail to compile with the newer libpqxx version,
and you'll have to go through the `NEWS` file to find the API changes.  Usually
it'll be a small change, like an additional function you need to implement, or
a constant you need to define.


Converting types
----------------

In your application, a conversion is driven entirely by a C++ type you specify.
The value's SQL type on the database side has nothing to do with it.  Nor is
there anything in the string that would identify its type.  Your code says
"convert to this type" and libpqxx does it.

So, if you've SELECTed a 64-bit integer from the database, and you try to
convert it to a C++ `short,` one of two things will happen: either the number
is small enough to fit in your `short` and it just works, or else it throws a
conversion exception.  Similarly, if you try to read a 32-bit SQL `int` as a
C++ 32-bit `unsigned int`, that'll work fine, unless the value happens to be
negative.  In such cases the conversion will throw a `conversion_error`.

Or, your database table might have a text column, but a given field may contain
a string that _looks_ just like a number.  You can convert that value to an
integer type just fine.  Or to a floating-point type.  All that matters to the
conversion is the actual value, and the type that your code specifies.

Conversions to strings can tell the type from the arguments you pass them:

```cxx
    auto x = to_string(99);
```

For conversions in the other direction you need to instantiate the function
template explicitly:

```cxx
    auto y = from_string<int>("99");
```


Supporting a new type
---------------------

Let's say you have some other SQL type which you want to be able to store in,
or retrieve from, the database.  What would it take to support that?

Sometimes you do not need _complete_ support.  You might need a conversion _to_
a string but not _from_ a string, or vice versa.  You write out the conversion
at compile time, so don't be too afraid to be incomplete.  If you leave out one
of these steps, it's not going to crash at run time or mess up your data.  The
worst that can happen is that your code won't build.

So what do you need for a complete conversion?

First off, of course, you need a C++ type.  It may be your own, but it doesn't
have to be.  It could be a type from a third-party library, or even one from
the standard library that libpqxx does not yet support.

First thing to do is specialise the `pqxx::name_type()` function to give the
type a human-readable name.  That allows libpqxx error messages and such to
talk about the type in a clear way.  If you don't define it, libpqxx will try
to figure one out with some help from the compiler, but it may not always be
easy to read.  In C++26 we expect to get a standard way to query the name, but
until then it's a bit messy.

Then, does your type have a built-in null value?  For example, a `char *` can
be null on the C++ side.  Or some types are _always_ null, such as `nullptr`.
You specialise the `pqxx::nullness` template to specify the details.

Finally, you specialise the `pqxx::string_traits` template.  This is where you
define the actual conversions.

Let's go through these steps one by one.


Your type
---------

You'll need a type for which the conversions are not yet defined, because the
C++ type is what determines the right conversion.  One type gets one pair of
conversions (to/from SQL strings).

The type doesn't have to be one that you create.  The conversion logic was
designed such that you can build it around any type.  So you can just as
easily build a conversion for a type that's defined somewhere else.  There's
no need to include any special methods or other members inside the type itself.
This is also why libpqxx can convert built-in types like `int`.

By the way, if the type is an enum (let's say it's called `my_enum`), you don't
need to do any of this.  Just invoke the preprocessor macro
`PQXX_DECLARE_ENUM_CONVERSION(my_enum)`, from the global namespace near the top
of your translation unit.

The library also provides conversions for `std::optional<T>`,
`std::shared_ptr<T>`, and `std::unique_ptr<T>` (for any given `T`).  If you
have conversions for `T`, you'll also automatically have conversions for those.


Specialise `name_type()`
------------------------

(This is a feature that should disappear once we have introspection in the C++
language.  The current expectation is that C++26 will have a standard, reliable
way for the code to obtain a type's name.)

When errors happen during conversion, libpqxx will compose an error message
that the application can show to the user, or write to a log.  Sometimes this
message will need to mention the name of the type that's being converted.

By default, this will probably work fine on some compilers, or the name may
come out a little strange on other compilers, but some make the names harder to
recognise.  So it can help to define a name yourself.

To tell libpqxx the human-readable name of a type `T`, there's a function
template called `pqxx::name_type()`.  This function should exist for any given
type `T`:

```cxx
    // T is your type.
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> inline constexpr std::string_view
    name_type<T>() noexcept { return "My T type's name"; };
    }
```

(Yes, this means that you need to define something inside the pqxx namespace.)

Define this early on in your translation unit, before any code that might cause
libpqxx to need the name.  That way, the libpqxx code which needs to know the
type's name can see your definition.

In cases where the name is not a simple compile-time constant but needs code
to compute, you may need to make its type `std::string`.  A `string_view` does
not maintain storage space for the text it contains.  However, some code
analysis tools may report false posiives when initialising such strings at
initialisation time.


Specialise `nullness`
---------------------

A struct template `pqxx::nullness` defines whether your type has a natural
"null value" built in.  For example, a `std::optional` instantiation has a
value that neatly maps to an SQL null: the un-initialised state.

If your type has a value like that, its `pqxx::nullness` specialisation also
provides member functions for producing and recognising null values.

The simplest scenario is also the most common: most types don't have a null
value built in.  There is no "null `int`" in C++.  In that kind of case, just
derive your nullness traits from `pqxx::no_null` as a shorthand:  This tells
libpqxx that your type has no null value of its own.

```cxx
    // T is your type.
    namespace pqxx
    {
    template<> struct nullness<T> : pqxx::no_null<T> {};
    }
```

(Here again you're defining this in the pqxx namespace.)

Nullness is not part of the `string_traits` because as far as the string
conversion system is concerned, a null is not a value!  You can't convert it
to or from a string.  Consider what would happen if you tried to convert a
null value to an SQL string: you'd get a string containing the value `NULL`,
not the null value.  Handling of nulls happens at a higher level, when passing
parameters to SQL statements, or quoting-and-escaping values for inclusion in
SQL statements as literal values.

If your type has a natural null value, the definition for `nullness` gets a
little more complex than the one above:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    // T is your type.
    template<> struct nullness<T>
    {
      // Does T have a value that should translate to an SQL null?
      static constexpr bool has_null{true};

      // Does this C++ type _always_ denote an SQL null, like with nullptr_t?
      static constexpr bool always_null{false};

      // Is `value` a null?
      static bool is_null(T const &value)
      {
        return ...;
      }

      // Return a null.
      [[nodiscard]] static T null()
      {
        return ...;
      }
    };
    }
```

(In writing an application, if you have a type like `int` that doesn't have a
null value but you need to pass or parse an SQL value that may be null, you can
use `std::optional<int>` instead.  An `optional` without a value is a null.)

You may be wondering why there's a function to produce a null value, but also a
function to check whether a value is null.  Why not just compare the value to
the result of `null()`?  Because two null values may not be equal.  It could be
like in SQL, where `NULL` is not equal to anything including `NULL`.  Or there
may be several different null values.  Or `T` may override the comparison
operator to behave in some unusual way.

As a third case, your type may be one that _always_ represents a null value.
This is the case for `std::nullptr_t` and `std::nullopt_t`.  In a case like
that, you set `nullness<TYPE>::always_null` to `true` (as well as `has_null`
of course), and you won't need to define any actual conversions.


Specialise `string_traits`
-------------------------

This part is the most work.  You can skip it for types that are always null,
but of course those are extremely rare.

The APIs for doing this are designed to avoid, where opssible, the need to
allocate memory on the free store (a.k.a. "the heap").  In other words, the API
minimises use of `new`/`delete`, even ones hidden inside `std::string`,
`std::vector`, etc.  The conversion API allows you to use `std::string` for
convenience, or fixed memory buffers for maximum speed.

Start by specialising the `pqxx::string_traits` template.  It has conversion
functions going in both directions: from a C++ value to an SQL string, and from
an SQL string to a C++ value.  You don't absolutely have to implement both.
Generally, if the code you need compiles, you're OK for the time being.  Just
bear in mind that future libpqxx versions may change the API — or how it uses
the API internally.  In fact libpqxx 8.0 made a lot of changes compared to 7.x.

As of 8.0, this is what a full specialisation of `string_traits` looks like:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    // T is your type.
    template<> struct string_traits<T>
    {
      // If you support conversion _to_ an SQL string:

      // Represent `value` as a string, using `buf` for storage if needed.
      // (But the result may live somewhere outside the buffer, or lie inside
      // it but not start exactly at the beginning of the buffer.  It may even
      // be a reference back to `value` itself.)
      //
      // We'll explain the context `c` further down.
      static [[nodiscard]] std::string_view to_buf(
        std::span<char> buf, T const &value, ctx c = {});

      // Converting value to string may require at most this much buffer space.
      static [[nodiscard]] std::size_t size_buffer(T const &value) noexcept;

      // If you support conversion _from_ an SQL string:

      // Parse `text` as a T value.
      static [[nodiscard]] T from_string(std::string_view text, ctx c = {});
    };
    }
```

In your own code, you typically wouldn't call these functions yourself by the
way.  Instead you'd call global wrappers: `pqxx::to_string()`,
`pqxx::to_buf()`, `pqxx::into_buf()` (it's subtly different), and
`pqxx::size_buffer()`.


### `ctx`

Notice those `ctx` parameters, with a default value of `{}`?  These hold some
additional "context" information for the conversion.  It has no clearly
defined role, except to hold extra information that your conversion may or may
not need.  Passing it in this way makes it easier for libpqxx to extend the
conversion API further in the future without breaking compatibility.

The name `ctx` is shorthand for `pqxx::conversion_context const t&`.  There
are reasonable defaults for every item in there, so it's acceptable for a
caller to leave it out.

As of libpqxx 8.0, `conversion_context` contains:

* `pqxx::encoding_group enc`.  This tells the conversion just enough about the
  text's encoding do to its job.  It doesn't say exactly whether the text is in
  UTF-8, or Latin-15, or EUC-KR, and so on.  But it's enough that the code can
  figure out where each character begins and ends, which is all the
  understanding that it really needs.
  which is all that most conversions need.
* `std::source_location loc`.  We abbreviate that type as `pqxx::sl` because it
  shows up in so many places.  In case the conversion throws an exception, the
  exception can include this source location in its message as a debugging
  hint.

There may be more fields in the future.

The encoding group defaults to a special group, `unknown`.  This is good enough
for dealing with plain ASCII text, which is all that most conversions need.
If your conversion does need to know the text's encoding, it is up to the code
calling the conversion to pass that information along.

The source location defaults to the location of the immediate calling code.
But if that caller is also within libpqxx, this isn't usually very helpful to
application authors trying to debug errors.  Therefore we try to pass the
location where control last transferred from the application into libpqxx.


### `from_string`

Now we start implementing the functions.  We start off simple: `from_string`
parses a string as an SQL value and translates it into a C++ value of type `T`
(your type).

The string is a `std::string_view`, which means it doesn't necessarily end in
a terminating zero.  In many situations there will still be a zero just after
the string, so be sure to have your tests cover cases where there's a non-zero
byte behind the string!

It's always possible that the string doesn't actually represent a `T` value.
Mistakes happen.  There can be corner cases.  Maybe a value is outside the
range you can reasonably support, such as when you're trying to read an SQL
`integer` into an `unsigned int` and it happens to be negative.  When you run
into that kind of thing, throw a `pqxx::conversion_error`.

(Of course it's also possible that you run into some other error, so it's fine
to throw different exceptions as well.  But when it's definitely "this is not
the right format for a `T`," throw `conversion_error`.)


### `to_buf`

In this function, you convert a value of `T` into a string that the postgres
server will understand.

The caller will provide you with a buffer where you can write the string, if
you need it.  But for this function it doesn't really matter where you store
the string: somewhere inside the buffer, or as a string constant, or even by
referring to the input value.  The buffer is just there in case that you need
it.  Usually you do.

What you can _not_ do is allocate some memory to store your SQL text.  If `buf`
is not large enough to store your output, throw a `pqxx::conversion_overrun`.
This doesn't have to be exact: you can be a little pessimistic and demand a bit
more space than you actually need.  We'll get to the negotiation for how much
buffer space you need later.  Just be sure to throw the exception if there's
any risk of overrunning the buffer.

Beware of locales when converting.  If you use standard library features like
`sprintf`, they may obey whatever locale is currently set on the system where
the code runs.   That means that a simple integer like 1000000 may come out as
"1000000" on your system, but as "1,000,000" on mine, or as "1.000.000" for
somebody else, and on an Indian system it may be "1,00,000".  Don't let that
happen, or it will confuse things.  Use only non-locale-sensitive library
functions.  Values coming from or going to the database should be in fixed,
non-localised formats.

If your type contains fields of types that libpqxx already supports, you can
use the existing conversion functions for those: `pqxx::from_string`,
`pqxx::to_string`, `pqxx::to_buf`, etc.  They in turn will call the
`string_traits` specialisations for those types.  For example, if you wanted to
convert a date, you might use the `int` conversions for each of the year,
month, and date numbers.


### `size_buffer`

Here you estimate how much buffer space you may need for converting a `T` to an
SQL string.  Be precise if you can, but pessimistic if you must.  It's usually
better to waste a few bytes of space than to spend a lot of time computing
the exact buffer space you need.  And failing the conversion because you
under-budgeted the buffer is worst of all.

Make `size_buffer` a `constexpr` function if you can.  It may sometiems allow
the caller to allocate the buffer on the stack, with a size known at compile
time.


Optional: Specialise `is_unquoted_safe`
---------------------------------------

When converting arrays or composite values to strings, libpqxx may need to
quote values and escape any special characters.  This takes time.

Some types though, such as integral or floating-point types, can never have
any special characters such as quotes, commas, or backslashes in their string
representations.  In such cases, there's no need to quote or escape such values
in SQL arrays or composite types.

If your type is like that, you can tell libpqxx about this by defining:

```cxx
    namespace pqxx
    {
    // T is your type.
    template<> inline constexpr bool is_unquoted_safe<T>{true};
    }
```

The code that converts this type of field to strings in an array or a composite
type can then use a simpler, more efficient variant of the code.  It's always
safe to leave this out; it's _just_ an optimisation for when you're completely
sure that it's safe.

Make sure this definition is visible wherever you call libpqxx code that may
call your conversoin.

Do not do this if a string representation of your type may contain a comma;
semicolon; parenthesis; brace; quote; backslash; newline; or any other
character that might need escaping.


Optional: Specialise `param_format`
-----------------------------------

This one you don't generally need to worry about.  Read on if you're writing a
type which represents raw binary data, or if you're writing a template where
_some specialisations_ may contain raw binary data.

When you call parameterised statements, or prepared statements with parameters,
libpqxx needs to pass your parameters on to libpq, the underlying C-level
PostgreSQL client library.

There are two formats for doing that: _text_ and _binary._  In the first, we
represent all values as strings in the PostgreSQL text format, and the server
then converts them into its own internal binary representation.  That's what
those string conversions above are all about, and it's what we do for almost
all types of parameters.

But we do it differently when the parameter is a contiguous series of raw bytes
and the corresponding SQL type is `BYTEA`.  There is a text format for those,
but we bypass it for efficiency.  In this situation the server can use the
binary data in the exact same form in which you provide it, without any
conversion or extra processing.  The binary data for BYTEA is also twice as
compact during transport.

(People sometimes ask why we can't just treat all types as binary.  However the
general case isn't so clear-cut.  The binary formats are not documented, there
are no guarantees that they will be platform-independent or that they will
remain stable across postgres releases, and there's no really solid way to
detect when we might get the format wrong.  On top of all that, the conversions
aren't necessarily as straightforward and efficient as they sound.  So, for the
general case, libpqxx sticks with the text formats.  Raw binary data alone
stands out as a clear win.)

Long story short, the machinery for passing parameters needs to know: is this
parameter a binary string, or not?  In the normal case it can assume "no," and
that's what it does.  The text format is always a safe choice; we just try to
use the binary format where it's faster, and safe.

The `param_format` function template is what drives the decision.  We
specialise it for types which may be binary strings, and use the default for
all other types.

"Types which _may_ be binary"?  You might think we know whether a type is a
binary type or not.  But there are some complications with generic types.

Templates like `std::shared_ptr`, `std::optional`, and so on act like
"wrappers" for another type.  A `std::optional<T>` is binary if `T` is binary.
Otherwise, it's not.  And `std::variant` may contain wildly different types, so
the decision can even be based on the individual object rather than just the
type.  If you're building support for a template of this nature, you'll
probably want to implement `param_format` for it.

Containers are another hard case.  Should we pass `std::vector<T>` in binary?
Even when `T` is a binary type, we don't currently have any way to pass an
array in binary format, so we always pass it as text.
