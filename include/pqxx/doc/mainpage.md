Welcome to libpqxx, the C++ API to the PostgreSQL database management system.

Compiling this package requires PostgreSQL to be installed -- including the
C headers for client development.  The library builds on top of PostgreSQL's
standard C API, libpq.  The libpq headers are not needed to compile client
programs, however.

For a quick introduction to installing and using libpqxx, see the README.md
file.  The latest information can be found at
