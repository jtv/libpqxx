/// Efficiently write data directly to a database table.
/** If you wish to insert rows of data into a table, you can compose INSERT
 * statements and execute them.  But it's slow and tedious, and you need to
 * worry about quoting and escaping the data.
 *
 * If you're just inserting a single row, it probably won't matter much.  You
 * can use prepared or parameterised statements to take care of the escaping
 * for you.  But if you're inserting large numbers of rows you will want
 * something better.
 *
 * Inserting rows one by one using INSERT statements involves a lot of
 * pointless overhead, especially when you are working with a remote database
 * server over the network.  You may end up sending each row over the network
 * as a separate query, and waiting for a reply.  Do it "in bulk" using
 * `stream_to`, and you may find that it goes many times faster.  Sometimes
 * you gain orders of magnitude in speed.
 *
 * Here's how it works: you create a `stream_to` stream to start writing to
 * your table.  You will probably want to specify the columns.  Then, you
 * feed your data into the stream one row at a time.  And finally, you call the
 * stream's @ref complete function to tell it to finalise the operation, wait
 * for completion, and check for errors.
 *
 * (You _must_ complete the stream before committing or aborting the
 * transaction.  The connection is in a special state while the stream is
 * active, where it can't process commands, and can't commit or abort a
 * transaction.)
 *
 * So how do you feed a row of data into the stream?  There's several ways, but
 * the preferred one is to call its @ref write_values.  Pass the field values
 * as arguments.  Doesn't matter what type they are, as long as libpqxx knows
 * how to convert them to PostgreSQL's text format: `int`, `std::string` or
 * `std:string_view`, `float` and `double`, `bool`...  lots of basic types
 * are supported.  If some of the values are null, feel free to use
 * `std::optional`, `std::shared_ptr`, or `std::unique_ptr`.
 *
 * The arguments' types don't even have to match the fields' SQL types.  If you
 * want to insert an `int` into a `DECIMAL` column, that's your choice -- it
 * will produce a `DECIMAL` value which happens to be integral.  Insert a
 * `float` into a `VARCHAR` column?  That's fine, you'll get a string whose
 * contents happen to read like a number.  And so on.  You can even insert
 * different types of value in the same column on different rows.  If you have
 * a code path where a particular field is always null, just insert `nullptr`.
 *
 * There is another way to insert rows: the `<<` ("shift-left") operator.
 * It's not as fast and it doesn't support variable arguments: each row must be
 * either a `std::tuple` or something iterable, such as a `std::vector`, or
 * anything else with a `begin()` and `end()`.
 *
 * @warning While a stream is active, you cannot execute queries, open a
 * pipeline, etc. on the same transaction.  A transaction can have at most one
 * object of a type derived from @ref pqxx::transaction_focus active on it at a
 * time.
