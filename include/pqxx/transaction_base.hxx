/**
 * @defgroup transactions Transaction classes
 *
 * All database access goes through instances of these classes.  In libpqxx
 * you can't execute SQL directly on the connection object; that all happens
 * only on a transaction object.  If you don't actually want to start a
 * transaction on the server, there's a @ref nontransaction class which
 * operates in _autocommit,_ i.e. without a transaction.
 *
 * (Why do you always need a transaction object?  It ended up being the cleaner
 * choice in terms of interface design.  It avoids a bunch of API maladies:
 * duplicating API between classes, messy inheritance, inviting mistakes by
 * making the transaction afterthought, and so on.)
 *
 * Like most other things in libpqxx, transactions follow RAII principles.
 * Creating a transaction object starts the transaction on the backend (if
 * appropriate), and to destroying one ends the transaction.  But there's one
 * extra step: if you want to make the transaction's changes permanent, you
 * need to _commit_ it before you destroy it.  If you destroy the transaction
 * object without committing, or if you call its `abort()` member function,
 * then any transaction type (other than @ref nontransaction) will roll back
 * its changes to the database instead.
 *
 * There is a choice of transaction types.  To start with you'll probably want
 * to use @ref work, represents a regular, vanilla transaction with the default
 * isolation level.
 *
 * All the actual transaction functionality, including all the functions for
 * executing SQL statements, lives in the abstract @ref transaction_base class.
 * It defines the API for each type of transaction.  You create a transaction,
 * you use it by calling @ref transaction_base member functions, and then you
 * either commit or (in the case of failure) abort.  If you destroy your
 * transaction object without doing either, it automatically aborts.
 *
 * Once you're done with your transaction, you can start a new one using the
 * same connection.  But there can be only one main transaction going on on a
 * connection at any given time.  (You _can_ have more "nested" transactions,
 * but I'm not counting those as "main" transactions here.  See below.)
 *
 * The concrete transaction types, all derived from @ref transaction_base, are:
 *
 * First and foremost, the plain @ref transaction template.  Template
 * parameters let you select isolation level, and whether it should be
 * read-only.  Two aliases are usually more convenient: @ref work is a
 * regular, run-of-the-mill default transaction.  @ref read_transaction is a
 * read-only transaction that will not let you modify the database.
 *
 * Then there's @ref nontransaction.  This one runs in autocommit, meaning
 * that we don't start any transaction at all.  (Technically in this mode each
 * SQL command runs in its own little transaction, hence the term
 * "autocommit."  There is no way to "undo" an SQL statement in this kind of
 * transaction.)  Autocommit is sometimes a bit faster, and sometimes a bit
 * slower.  Mainly you'll use it for specific operations that cannot be done
 *inside a database transaction, such as some kinds of schema changes.
 *
 * And then ther's @ref robusttransaction to help you deal with those painful
 * situations where you don't know for sure whether a transaction actually
 * succeeded.  This can happen if you lose your network connection to the
 * database _just_ while you're trying to commit your transaction, before you
 * receive word about the outcome.  You can re-connect and find out, but what
 * if the server is still executing the commit?
 *
 * You could say that @ref robusttransaction is not more robust, exactly, but
 * it goes to some extra effort to try and figure these situations out and give
 * you clarity.  Extra effort does actually mean more things that can go wrong,
 * and it may be a litte slower, so investigate carefully before using this
 * transaction class.
 *
 * All of the transaction types that actually begin and commit/abort on the
 * database itself are derived from @ref dbtransaction, which can be a useful
 * type if your code needs a reference to such a transaction but doesn't need
 * to enforce a particular one.  These types are @ref transaction, @ref work,
 * @ref read_transaction, and @ref robusttransaction.
 *
 * Finally, there's @ref subtransaction.  This one is not at all like the
 * others: it can only exist inside a @ref dbtransaction.  (Which includes
 * @ref subtransaction itself: you can nest them freely.)  You can only
 * operate on the "innermost" active subtransaction at any given time, until
 * you either commit or abort it.  Subtransactions are built on _savepoints_
 * in the database; these are efficient to a point but do consume some server
 * resources.  So use them when they make sense, e.g. to try an SQL statement
 * but continue your main transation if it fails.  But don't create them in
 * enormous numbers, or performance may start to suffer.

   * @name Command execution
   *
   * There are many functions for executing (or "performing") a command (or
   * "query").  This is the most fundamental thing you can do in libpqxx, and
   * it always starts at a transaction class.
   *
   * Command execution can throw many types of exception, including sql_error,
   * broken_connection, and many sql_error subtypes such as
   * feature_not_supported or insufficient_privilege.  But any exception thrown
   * by the C++ standard library may also occur here.  All exceptions you will
   * see libpqxx throw are derived from std::exception.
   *
   * Most of the differences between the query execution functions are in how
   * they return the query's results.
   *
   * * The "query" functions run your query, wait for it to complete, and load
   *   all of the results into memory on the client side.  You can then access
   *   rows of result data, converted to C++ types that you request.
   * * The "stream" functions execute your query in a completely different way.
   *   Called _streaming queries,_ these don't support quite the full range of
   *   SQL queries, and they're a bit slower to start.  But they are
   *   significantly _faster_ for queries that return larger numbers of rows.
   *   They don't load the entire result set, so you can start processing data
   *   as soon as the first row of data comes in from the database.  This can
   *   This can save you a lot of time.  Processing itself may also be faster.
   *   And of course, it also means you don't need enough memory to hold the
   *   entire result set, just the row you're working on.
   * * The "exec" functions are a more low-level interface.  Most of them
   *   return a pqxx::result object.  This is an object that contains all
   *   information abouut the query's result: the data itself, but also the
   *   number of rows in the result, the column names, the number of rows that
   *   your query may have modified, and so on.

   * specify.  Unlike with the "exec" functions, processing can start before
   * all the data from the server is in.
   *
   * Streaming is also documented in @ref streams.
   *
   * The column types must all be types that have conversions from PostgreSQL's
   * text format defined.  Many built-in types such as `int` or `std::string`
   * have pre-defined conversions; if you want to define your own conversions
   * for additional types, see @ref datatypes.
   *
   * As a special case, tuple may contain `std::string_view` fields, but the
   * strings to which they point will only remain valid until you extract the
   * next row.  After that, the memory holding the string may be overwritten or
   * deallocated.
   *
   * If any of the columns can be null, and the C++ type to which you're
   * translating it does not have a null value, wrap the type in a
   * `std::optional<>` (or if you prefer, a `std::shared_ptr<>` or a
   * `std::unique_ptr`).  These templates do support null values, and libpqxx
   * will know how to convert to them.
   *
   * The stream lives entirely within the lifetime of the transaction.  Make
   * sure you complete the stream before you destroy the transaction.  Until
   * the stream has finished, the transaction and the connection are in a
   * special state where they cannot be used for anything else.
   *
   * @warning If the stream fails, you will have to destroy the transaction
   * and the connection.  If this is a problem, use the "exec" functions
   * instead.
   *
   * Streaming your query is likely to be faster than the `exec()` methods for
   * larger results (but slower for small results), and start useful processing
   * sooner.  Also, `stream()` scales better in terms of memory usage: it only
   * needs to keep the current row in memory.  The "exec" functions read the
   * entire result into memory at once.
   *
   * Your query executes as part of a COPY command, not as a stand-alone query,
   * so there are limitations to what you can do in the query.  It can be
   * either a SELECT or VALUES query; or an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE with a
   * RETURNING clause.  See the documentation for PostgreSQL's
   * [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) for
   * the exact restrictions.
   *
   * Iterating in this way does require each of the field types you pass to be
   * default-constructible, copy-constructible, and assignable.  These
   * requirements may loosen a bit once libpqxx moves on to C++20.

   * quote it and escape any special characters inside it, or it may become a
   * target for an SQL injection attack.  If it's an integer (for example),
   * you need to convert it to a string, but in the database's format, without

   * Parameterised statements are an easier and safer way to do this.  They're
   * like prepared statements, but for a single use.  You don't need to name
   * them, and you don't need to prepare them first.
   *
   * Your query will include placeholders like `$1` and `$2` etc. in the places
   * where you want the arguments to go.  Then, you pass the argument values
   * and the actual query is constructed for you.
   *
   * Pass the exact right number of parameters, and in the right order.  The
   * parameters in the query don't have to be neatly ordered from `$1` to
   * `$2` to `$3` - but you must pass the argument for `$1` first, the one
   * for `$2` second, etc.
   *
   * @warning Beware of "nul" bytes.  Any string you pass as a parameter will
   * end at the first char with value zero.  If you pass a string that contains
   * a zero byte, the last byte in the value will be the one just before the
   * zero.
