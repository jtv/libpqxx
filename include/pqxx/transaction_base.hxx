/**
 * @defgroup transactions Transaction classes
 *
 * All database access goes through instances of these classes.
 * However, not all implementations of this interface need to provide full
 * transactional integrity.
 *
 * You'll find several implementations of this interface in libpqxx, including
 * the plain @ref transaction class, the entirely unprotected
 * @ref nontransaction, and the more cautious @ref robusttransaction.
 *
 * Like most other things in libpqxx, transactions follow RAII principles:
 * creating a transaction object means to start the transaction, and to destroy
 * it means to end the transaction.  But there's one extra step: if you want to
 * make the transaction's changes permanent, you need to _commit_ it at the
 * end.  If you destroy the transaction object without committing it, or if you
 * call its `abort()` member function, then the transaction will roll back its
 * effects instead.
 *
 * The big exception to all this is @ref nontransaction.  It gives you the
 * transaction API but without actually starting a transaction on the database.

  /**
   * @name Command execution
   *
   * There are many functions for executing (or "performing") a command (or
   * "query").  This is the most fundamental thing you can do in libpqxx, and
   * it always starts at a transaction class.
   *
   * Command execution can throw many types of exception, including sql_error,
   * broken_connection, and many sql_error subtypes such as
   * feature_not_supported or insufficient_privilege.  But any exception thrown
   * by the C++ standard library may also occur here.  All exceptions you will
   * see libpqxx throw are derived from std::exception.
   *
   * Most of the differences between the query execution functions are in how
   * they return the query's results.
   *
   * * The "query" functions run your query, wait for it to complete, and load
   *   all of the results into memory on the client side.  You can then access
   *   rows of result data, converted to C++ types that you request.
   * * The "stream" functions execute your query in a completely different way.
   *   Called _streaming queries,_ these don't support quite the full range of
   *   SQL queries, and they're a bit slower to start.  But they are
   *   significantly *   _faster_ for queries that return larger numbers of
   *   rows.  They don't load the entire result set, so you can start
   *   processing data as soon as the first row of data comes in from the
   *   database.  This can save you a lot of time.  Processing itself may also
   *   be faster.  And of course, it also means you don't need enough memory to
   *   hold the entire result set, just the row you're working on.
   * * The "exec" functions are a more low-level interface.  Most of them
   *   return a pqxx::result object.  This is an object that contains all
   *   information abouut the query's result: the data itself, but also the
   *   number of rows in the result, the column names, the number of rows that
   *   your query may have modified, and so on.
   *
   * Some of these functions also give you the option to specify how many rows
   * of data you expect to get: `exec0()` reports a failure if the query
   * returns any rows of data at all, `exec1()` expects a single row of data
   * (and so returns a pqxx::row rather than a pqxx::result), `exec_n()` lets
   * you specify the number of rows you expect, and so on.

   * directly maps the resulting rows onto a `std::tuple` of the types you
   * specify.  Unlike with the "exec" functions, processing can start before
   * all the data from the server is in.
   *
   * As a special case, tuple may contain `std::string_view` fields, but the
   * strings to which they point will only remain valid until you extract the
   * next row.  After that, the memory holding the string may be overwritten or
   * deallocated.
   *
   * If any of the columns can be null, and the C++ type to which you're
   * translating it does not have a null value, wrap the type in a
   * `std::optional<>` (or if you prefer, a `std::shared_ptr<>` or a

   * The stream lives entirely within the lifetime of the transaction.  Make
   * sure you complete the stream before you destroy the transaction.  Until
   * the stream has finished, the transaction and the connection are in a
   * special state where they cannot be used for anything else.
   *
   * @warning If the stream fails, you will have to destroy the transaction
   * and the connection.  If this is a problem, use the "exec" functions
   * instead.
   *
   * Streaming your query is likely to be faster than the `exec()` methods for
   * larger results (but slower for small results), and start useful processing
   * sooner.  Also, `stream()` scales better in terms of memory usage: it only
   * needs to keep the current row in memory.  The "exec" functions read the
   * entire result into memory at once.
   *
   * Your query executes as part of a COPY command, not as a stand-alone query,
   * so there are limitations to what you can do in the query.  It can be
   * either a SELECT or VALUES query; or an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE with a
   * RETURNING clause.  See the documentation for PostgreSQL's
   * [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) for
   * the exact restrictions.
   *
   * Iterating in this way does require each of the field types you pass to be
   * default-constructible, copy-constructible, and assignable.  These
   * requirements may loosen a bit once libpqxx moves on to C++20.

  /**
   * @name Prepared statements
   *
   * These are very similar to parameterised statements.  The difference is
   * that you prepare them in advance, giving them identifying names.  You can
   * then call them by these names, passing in the argument values appropriate
   * for that call.
   *
   * You prepare a statement on the connection, using
   * @ref pqxx::connection::prepare().  But you then call the statement in a
   * transaction, using the functions you see here.
   *
   * Never try to prepare, execute, or unprepare a prepared statement manually
   * using direct SQL queries when you also use the libpqxx equivalents.  For
   * any given statement, either prepare, manage, and execute it through the
   * dedicated libpqxx functions; or do it all directly in SQL.  Don't mix the
   * two, or the code may get confused.
   *
   * See \ref prepared for a full discussion.
   *
   * @warning Beware of "nul" bytes.  Any string you pass as a parameter will
   * end at the first char with value zero.  If you pass a string that contains
   * a zero byte, the last byte in the value will be the one just before the
   * zero.  If you need a zero byte, you're dealing with binary strings, not
   * regular strings.  Represent binary strings on the SQL side as `BYTEA`
   * (or as large objects).  On the C++ side, use types like
   * `std::basic_string<std::byte>` or `std::basic_string_view<std::byte>`
   * or (in C++20) `std::vector<std::byte>`.  Also, consider large objects on
   * the SQL side and @ref blob on the C++ side.
