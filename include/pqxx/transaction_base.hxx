   *
   * Command execution can throw many types of exception, including sql_error,
   * broken_connection, and many sql_error subtypes such as
   * feature_not_supported or insufficient_privilege.  But any exception thrown
   * by the C++ standard library may also occur here.  All exceptions you will
   * see libpqxx are derived from std::exception.
   *
   * One unusual feature in libpqxx is that you can give your query a name or
   * description.  This does not mean anything to the database, but sometimes
   * it can help libpqxx produce more helpful error messages, making problems
   * in your code easier to debug.

   * directly maps the resulting rows onto a `std::tuple` of the types you
   * specify.  It starts before all the data from the server is in, so if your
   * network connection to the server breaks while you're iterating, you'll get
   * an exception partway through.
   *
   * The stream lives entirely within the lifetime of the transaction.  Make
   * sure you destroy the stream before you destroy the transaction.  Also,
   * either iterate the stream all the way to the end, or destroy first the
   * stream and then the transaction without touching either in any other way.
   * Until the stream has finished, the transaction is in a special state where
   * it cannot execute queries.
   *
   * As a special case, tuple may contain `std::string_view` fields, but the
   * strings to which they point will only remain valid until you extract the
   * next row.  After that, the memory holding the string may be overwritten or
   * deallocated.
   *
   * If any of the columns can be null, and the C++ type to which it translates
   * does not have a null value, wrap the type in `std::optional` (or if
   * you prefer, `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr)`.  These templates
   * do recognise null values, and libpqxx will know how to convert to them.
   *
   * The connection is in a special state until the iteration finishes.  So if
   * it does not finish due to a `break` or a `return` or an exception, then
   * the entire connection becomes effectively unusable.
   *
   * Querying in this way is faster than the `exec()` methods for larger
   * results (but probably slower for small ones).  Also, you can start
   * processing rows before the full result is in.  Also, `stream()` scales
   * better in terms of memory usage.  Where @ref exec() reads the entire
   * result into memory at once, `stream()` will read and process one row at at
   * a time.
   *
   * Your query executes as part of a COPY command, not as a stand-alone query,
   * so there are limitations to what you can do in the query.  It can be
   * either a SELECT or VALUES query; or an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE with a
   * RETURNING clause.  See the documentation for PostgreSQL's COPY command for
   * the details:
   *
   *     https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html
   *
   * Iterating in this way does require each of the field types you pass to be
   * default-constructible, copy-constructible, and assignable.  These
   * requirements may be loosened once libpqxx moves on to C++20.

   * Parameterised statements are an easier and safer way to do this.  They're
   * like prepared statements, but for a single use.  You don't need to name
   * them, and you don't need to prepare them first.
   *
   * Your query will include placeholders like `$1` and `$2` etc. in the places
   * where you want the arguments to go.  Then, you pass the argument values
   * and the actual query is constructed for you.
   *
   * Pass the exact right number of parameters, and in the right order.  The
   * parameters in the query don't have to be neatly ordered from `$1` to
   * `$2` to `$3` - but you must pass the argument for `$1` first, the one
   * for `$2` second, etc.
   *
   * @warning Beware of "nul" bytes.  Any string you pass as a parameter will
   * end at the first char with value zero.  If you pass a string that contains
   * a zero byte, the last byte in the value will be the one just before the
   * zero.
