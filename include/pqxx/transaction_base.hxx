   * with the value 2; the third receives a null, making its type irrelevant;
   * and number 4 again is an integer.  The ultimate invocation of exec() is

   * To see whether any prepared statement has been defined under a given name,

   * how to emulate prepared statements if some part of the infrastructure does
   * not support them.
   *
   * @warning Actual definition of the prepared statement on the backend may be
   * deferred until its first use, which means that any errors in the prepared
   * statement may not show up until it is executed--and perhaps abort the
   * ongoing transaction in the process.
   *
   * If you leave out the statement name, the call refers to the nameless
