/// connection_base abstract base class; represents a connection to a database.
/** This is the first class to look at when you wish to work with a database
 * through libpqxx.  Depending on the implementing concrete child class, a
 * connection can be automatically opened when it is constructed, or when it is
 * first used, or somewhere inbetween.  The connection is automatically closed
 * upon destruction (if it hasn't been closed already).
 *
 * To query or manipulate the database once connected, use one of the
 * transaction classes (see pqxx/transaction_base.hxx) or preferably the
 * transactor framework (see pqxx/transactor.hxx).
 *
 * If a network connection to the database server fails, the connection will be
 * restored automatically (although any transaction going on at the time will
 * have to be aborted).  This also means that any information set in previous
 * transactions that is not stored in the database, such as temp tables or
 * connection-local variables defined with PostgreSQL's SET command, will be
 * lost.  Whenever you create such state, either keept it local to one
 * transaction, where possible, or inhibit automatic reactivation of the
 * connection using the inhibit_reactivation() method.
 *
 * When a connection breaks, you will typically get a broken_connection
 * exception.  This can happen at almost any point, and the details may depend
 * on which connection class (all derived from this one) you use.
 *
 * As a general rule, always avoid raw queries if libpqxx offers a dedicated
 * function for the same purpose.  There may be hidden logic to hide certain
 * complications from you, such as reinstating session variables when a
 * broken or disabled connection is reactivated.
 *
 * @warning On Unix-like systems, including GNU and BSD systems, your program
 * may receive the SIGPIPE signal when the connection to the backend breaks.  By
 * default this signal will abort your program.  Use "signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)"
 * if you want your program to continue running after a connection fails.

   * integrity, never inside a transaction; but retrying the whole transaction
   * may implicitly cause the connection to be restored).  In normal use this is
   * quite a convenient thing to have and presents a simple, safe, predictable
   * interface.
   *
   * There is at least one situation where this feature is not desirable,
   * however.  Although most session state (prepared statements, session
   * variables) is automatically restored to its working state upon connection
   * reactivation, temporary tables and so-called WITH HOLD cursors (which can
   * live outside transactions) are not.
   *
   * Cursors that live outside transactions are automatically handled, and the
   * library will quietly ignore requests to deactivate or reactivate
   * connections while they exist; it does not want to give you the illusion of
   * being back in your transaction when in reality you just dropped a cursor.
   * With temporary tables this is not so easy: there is no easy way for the
   * library to detect their creation or track their lifetimes.
   *
   * So if your program uses temporary tables, and any part of this use happens
   * outside of any database transaction (or spans multiple transactions), some
   * of the work you have done on these tables may unexpectedly be undone if the
   * connection is broken or deactivated while any of these tables exists, and
   * then reactivated or implicitly restored before you are finished with it.
   *
   * If this describes any part of your program, guard it against unexpected
   * reconnections by inhibiting reconnection at the beginning.  And if you want
   * to continue doing work on the connection afterwards that no longer requires
   * the temp tables, you can permit it again to get the benefits of connection
   * reactivation for the remainder of the program.
   *
   * @param inhibit should reactivation be inhibited from here on?
   *
   * @warning Some connection types (the lazy and asynchronous types) defer
   * completion of the socket-level connection until it is actually needed by
   * the client program.  Inhibiting reactivation before this connection is
   * really established will prevent these connection types from doing their
   * work.  For those connection types, if you are sure that reactivation needs
   * to be inhibited before any query goes across the connection, activate() the
   * connection first.  This will ensure that definite activation happens before

   * @addtogroup escaping String escaping
   *
   * Use these functions to "groom" user-provided strings before using them in
   * your SQL statements.  This reduces the chance of failures when users type
   * unexpected characters, but more importantly, it helps prevent so-called SQL
   * injection attacks.
   *
   * To understand what SQL injection vulnerabilities are and why they should be
   * prevented, imagine you use the following SQL statement somewhere in your
   * program:
   *
   * @code
   *	TX.exec("SELECT number,amount "
   *		"FROM accounts "
   *		"WHERE allowed_to_see('" + userid + "','" + password + "')");
   * @endcode
   *
   * This shows a logged-in user important information on all accounts he is
   * authorized to view.  The userid and password strings are variables entered
   * by the user himself.
   *
   * Now, if the user is actually an attacker who knows (or can guess) the
   * general shape of this SQL statement, imagine he enters the following
   * password:
   *
   * @code
   *	x') OR ('x' = 'x
   * @endcode
   *
   * Does that make sense to you?  Probably not.  But if this is inserted into
   * the SQL string by the C++ code above, the query becomes:
   *
   * @code
   *	SELECT number,amount
   *	FROM accounts
   *	WHERE allowed_to_see('user','x') OR ('x' = 'x')
   * @endcode
   *
   * Is this what you wanted to happen?  Probably not!  The neat
   * allowed_to_see() clause is completely circumvented by the
   * "<tt>OR ('x' = 'x')</tt>" clause, which is always @c true.  Therefore, the
   * attacker will get to see all accounts in the database!
   *
   * To prevent this from happening, use the transaction's esc() function:
   *
   * @code
   *	TX.exec("SELECT number,amount "
   *		"FROM accounts "
   *		"WHERE allowed_to_see('" + TX.esc(userid) + "', "
   *			"'" + TX.esc(password) + "')");
   * @endcode
   *
   * Now, the quotes embedded in the attacker's string will be neatly escaped so
   * they can't "break out" of the quoted SQL string they were meant to go into:
   *
   * @code
   *	SELECT number,amount
   *	FROM accounts
   *	WHERE allowed_to_see('user', 'x'') OR (''x'' = ''x')
   * @endcode
   *
   * If you look carefully, you'll see that thanks to the added escape
   * characters (a single-quote is escaped in SQL by doubling it) all we get is
   * a very strange-looking password string--but not a change in the SQL
   * statement.
