// C++20: Can we use generators, and maybe get speedup from HALO?
/// Stream query results from the database.  Used by transaction_base::stream.
/** For larger data sets, retrieving data this way is likely to be faster than
 * executing a query and then iterating and converting the rows' fields.  You
 * will also be able to start processing before all of the data has come in.
 * (For smaller result sets though, a stream is likely to be a bit slower.)
 *
 * A `stream_query` stream is strongly typed.  You specify the columns' types
 * while instantiating the stream_query template.
 *
 * Not all kinds of query will work in a stream.  But straightforward `SELECT`
 * and `UPDATE ... RETURNING` queries should work.  The class uses PostgreSQL's
 * `COPY` command, so see the documentation for that command to get the full
 * details.
 *
 * There are other downsides.  If the stream encounters an error, it may leave
 * the entire connection in an unusable state, so you'll have to give the
 * whole thing up.  Finally, opening a stream puts the connection in a special
 * state, so you won't be able to do many other things with the connection or
 * the transaction while the stream is open.
 *
 * Usually you'll want the `stream` convenience wrapper in
 * @ref transaction_base, so you don't need to deal with this class directly.
 *
 * @warning While a stream is active, you cannot execute queries, open a
 * pipeline, etc. on the same transaction.  A transaction can have at most one
 * object of a type derived from @ref pqxx::transaction_focus active on it at a
 * time.
