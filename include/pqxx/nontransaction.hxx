/// Simple "transaction" class offering no transactional integrity.
/**
 * @addtogroup transaction Transaction classes
 *
 * nontransaction, like transaction or any other transaction_base-derived class,
 * provides access to a database through a connection.  Unlike its siblings,
 * however, nontransaction does not maintain any kind of transactional
 * integrity.  This may be useful eg. for read-only access to the database that
 * does not require a consistent, atomic view on its data; or for operations
 * that are not allowed within a backend transaction, such as creating tables.
 *
 * For queries that update the database, however, a real transaction is likely
 * to be faster unless the transaction consists of only a single record update.
 *
 * Also, you can keep a nontransaction open for as long as you like.  Actual
 * back-end transactions are limited in lifespan, and will sometimes fail just
 * because they took too long to execute or were left idle for too long.  This
 * will not happen with a nontransaction (although the connection may still time
 * out, e.g. when the network is unavailable for a very long time).
 *
 * Any query executed in a nontransaction is committed immediately, and neither
 * commit() nor abort() has any effect.
 *
 * Database features that require a backend transaction, such as cursors or
 * large objects, will not work in a nontransaction.
