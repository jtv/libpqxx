 * Result sets in libpqxx are lightweight, reference-counted wrapper objects

 * a "smart pointer" to an underlying result set.
 *
 * @warning The result set that a result object points to is not thread-safe.
 * If you copy a result object, it still refers to the same underlying result
 * set.  So never copy, destroy, query, or otherwise access a result while
 * another thread may be copying, destroying, querying, or otherwise accessing
 * the same result set--even if it is doing so through a different result
 * object!

   * single invocation to `func`.  If the reference is an lvalue reference, it

   *
   * If `func` throws an exception, processing stops at that point and
   * propagates the exception.
   *
   * @throws pqxx::usage_error if `func`'s number of parameters does not match
