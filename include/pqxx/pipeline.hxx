// TODO: libpq 14 introduced a similar "pipeline mode."  Can we use that?

/// Processes several queries in FIFO manner, optimized for high throughput.
/** Use a pipeline if you want to keep doing useful work while your queries are
 * executing.  Result retrieval is decoupled from execution request; queries
 * "go in at the front" and results "come out the back."
 *
 * Actually, you can retrieve the results in any order if you want, but it may
 * lead to surprising "time travel" effects if any of the queries fails.  In
 * particular, syntax errors in the queries can confuse things and show up too
 * early in the stream of results.
 *
 * Generally, if any of the queries fails, it will throw an exception at the
 * point where you request its result.  But it may happen earlier, especially
 * if you request results out of chronological order.
 *
 * @warning While a pipeline is active, you cannot execute queries, open
 * streams, etc. on the same transaction.  A transaction can have at most one
 * object of a type derived from @ref pqxx::transaction_focus active on it at a
 * time.
