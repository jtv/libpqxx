/**
 * @addtogroup connection
 *
 * Use of the libpqxx library starts here.
 *
 * Everything that can be done with a database through libpqxx must go through
 * a @c connection object.  It connects to a database when you create it, and
 * it terminates that communication during destruction.
 *
 * Many things come together in this class.  Handling of error and warning
 * messages, for example, is defined by @c errorhandler objects in the context
 * of a connection.  Prepared statements are also defined here.
 *
 * When you connect to a database, you pass a connection string containing any
 * parameters and options, such as the server address and the database name.
 *
 * These are identical to the ones in libpq, the C language binding upon which
 * libpqxx itself is built:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING
 *
 * There are also environment variables you can set to provide defaults, again
 * as defined by libpq:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html

 *
 * When creating a connection, you can pass a connection URI or a postgres
 * connection string, to specify the database server's address, a login
 * username, and so on.  If none is given, the connection will try to obtain
 * them from certain environment variables.  If those are not set either, the
 * default is to try and connect to the local system's port 5432.
 *
 * Find more about connection strings here:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING
 *
 * The variables are documented here:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html
 *
 * To query or manipulate the database once connected, use one of the
 * transaction classes (see pqxx/transaction_base.hxx) and perhaps also the
 * transactor framework (see pqxx/transactor.hxx).
 *
 * When a connection breaks, you will typically get a broken_connection
 * exception.  This can happen at almost any point.
 *
 * @warning On Unix-like systems, including GNU and BSD systems, your program
 * may receive the SIGPIPE signal when the connection to the backend breaks. By
 * default this signal will abort your program.  Use "signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)"
 * if you want your program to continue running after a connection fails.

   * Prepared statement definitions are not sensitive to transaction

   * outside that transaction, even if the transaction itself is subsequently
   * aborted.  Once a statement has been prepared, it will only go away if you
   * close the connection or explicitly "unprepare" the statement.
   *
   * Use the @c pqxx::transaction_base::exec_prepared functions to execute a
   * prepared statement.  See \ref prepared for a full discussion.
   *
   * @warning Using prepared statements can save time, but if your statement
   * takes parameters, it may also make your application significantly slower!
   * The reason is that the server works out a plan for executing the query
   * when you prepare it.  At that time, of course it does not know the values
   * for the parameters that you will pass.  If you execute a query without
   * preparing it, then the server works out the plan on the spot, with full
   * knowledge of the parameter values.
   *
   * A statement's definition can refer to its parameters as @c $1, @c $2, etc.
   * The first parameter you pass to the call provides a value for @c $1, and
   * so on.
   *
   * Here's an example of how to use prepared statements.
   *
   * @code
   * using namespace pqxx;
   * void foo(connection &c)
   * {
   *   c.prepare("findtable", "select * from pg_tables where name=$1");
