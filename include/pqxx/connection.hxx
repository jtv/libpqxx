/**
 * @addtogroup connections
 *
 * Use of the libpqxx library starts here.
 *
 * Everything that can be done with a database through libpqxx must go through
 * a @ref pqxx::connection object.  It connects to a database when you create
 * it, and it terminates that communication during destruction.
 *
 * Many things come together in this class.  Handling of error and warning
 * messages, for example, is defined by @ref pqxx::errorhandler objects in the
 * context of a connection.  Prepared statements are also defined here.
 *
 * When you connect to a database, you pass a connection string containing any
 * parameters and options, such as the server address and the database name.
 *
 * These are identical to the ones in libpq, the C language binding upon which
 * libpqxx itself is built:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING
 *
 * There are also environment variables you can set to provide defaults, again
 * as defined by libpq:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html
 *
 * You can also create a database connection _asynchronously_ using an
 * intermediate @ref pqxx::connecting object.

 * construction, and closes upon destruction.  If the connection attempt fails,
 * you will not get a @ref connection object; the constructor will fail with a
 * @ref pqxx::broken_connection exception.
 *
 * When creating a connection, you can pass a connection URI or a postgres
 * connection string, to specify the database server's address, a login
 * username, and so on.  If you don't, the connection will try to obtain them
 * from certain environment variables.  If those are not set either, the
 * default is to try and connect to the local system's port 5432.
 *
 * Find more about connection strings here:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING
 *
 * The variables are documented here:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html
 *
 * To query or manipulate the database once connected, use one of the
 * transaction classes (see pqxx/transaction_base.hxx) and perhaps also the
 * transactor framework (see pqxx/transactor.hxx).
 *
 * When a connection breaks, or fails to establish itself in the first place,
 * you will typically get a @ref broken_connection exception.  This can happen
 * at almost any point.
 *
 * @warning On Unix-like systems, including GNU and BSD systems, your program
 * may receive the SIGPIPE signal when the connection to the backend breaks. By
 * default this signal will abort your program.  Use "signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)"
 * if you want your program to continue running after a connection fails.

   *
   * PostgreSQL supports prepared SQL statements, i.e. statements that you can
   * register under a name you choose, optimized once by the backend, and

   *
   * Prepared statement definitions are not sensitive to transaction
   * boundaries. A statement defined inside a transaction will remain defined
   * outside that transaction, even if the transaction itself is subsequently
   * aborted.  Once a statement has been prepared, it will only go away if you
   * close the connection or explicitly "unprepare" the statement.
   *
   * Use the `pqxx::transaction_base::exec_prepared` functions to execute a
   * prepared statement.  See @ref prepared for a full discussion.
   *
   * @warning Using prepared statements can save time, but if your statement
   * takes parameters, it may also make your application significantly slower!
   * The reason is that the server works out a plan for executing the query
   * when you prepare it.  At that time, of course it does not know the values
   * for the parameters that you will pass.  If you execute a query without
   * preparing it, then the server works out the plan on the spot, with full
   * knowledge of the parameter values.
   *
   * A statement's definition can refer to its parameters as `$1`, `$2`, etc.
   * The first parameter you pass to the call provides a value for `$1`, and
   * so on.
   *
   * Here's an example of how to use prepared statements.
   *
   * ```cxx
   * using namespace pqxx;
   * void foo(connection &c)
   * {
   *   c.prepare("findtable", "select * from pg_tables where name=$1");

/** Use this when you want to create a connection to the database, but without

 *
 * Connecting in this way is probably not "faster" (it's more complicated and
 * has some extra overhead), but in some situations you can use it to make your
 * application as a whole faster.  It all depends on having other useful work
 * to do in the same thread, and being able to wait on a socket.  If you have
 * other I/O going on at the same time, your event loop can wait for both the
 * libpqxx socket and your own sockets, and wake up whenever any of them is
 * ready to do work.
 *
 * Connecting in this way is not properly "asynchronous;" it's merely
 * "nonblocking."  This means it's not a super-high-performance mechanism like
 * you might get with e.g. `io_uring`.  In particular, if we need to look up
 * the database hostname in DNS, that will happen synchronously.
 *
 * To use this, create the `connecting` object, passing a connection string.
 * Then loop: If @ref wait_to_read returns true, wait for the socket to have
 * incoming data on it.  If @ref wait_to_write returns true, wait for the
 * socket to be ready for writing.  Then call @ref process to process any
 * incoming or outgoing data.  Do all of this until @ref done returns true (or
 * there is an exception).  Finally, call @ref produce to get the completed
 * connection.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```cxx
 *     pqxx::connecting cg{};
 *
 *     // Loop until we're done connecting.
 *     while (!cg.done())
 *     {
 *         wait_for_fd(cg.sock(), cg.wait_to_read(), cg.wait_to_write());
 *         cg.process();
 *     }
 *
 *     pqxx::connection conn = std::move(cg).produce();
 *
 *     // At this point, conn is a working connection.  You can no longer use
 *     // cg at all.
