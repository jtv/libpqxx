 * all connection-related functionality) with a connection policy (a simpler
 * helper class determining the rules that govern the process of setting up the
 * underlying connection to the backend).
 *
 * The pattern used to combine these classes is the same as for
 * basic_transaction.  Through use of the template mechanism, the policy object
 * is embedded in the basic_connection object so that it does not need to be
 * allocated separately.  This also avoids the need for virtual functions in
 * this class.
