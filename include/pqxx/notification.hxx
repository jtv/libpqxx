/// "Observer" base class for notifications.
/** @addtogroup notification Notifications and Receivers
 *
 * To listen on a notification issued using the NOTIFY command, derive your own
 * class from notification_receiver and define its function-call operator to
 * perform whatever action you wish to take when the given notification
 * arrives. Then create an object of that class and pass it to your connection.
 * DO NOT use raw SQL to listen for notifications, or your attempts to listen
 * won't be resumed when a connection fails--and you'll have no way to notice.
 *
 * Notifications never arrive inside a transaction, not even in a
 * nontransaction.  Therefore, you are free to open a transaction of your own
 * inside your receiver's function invocation operator.
 *
 * Notifications you are listening for may arrive anywhere within libpqxx code,
 * but be aware that **PostgreSQL defers notifications occurring inside
 * transactions.**  (This was done for excellent reasons; just think about what
 * happens if the transaction where you happen to handle an incoming
 * notification is later rolled back for other reasons).  So if you're keeping
 * a transaction open, don't expect any of your receivers on the same
 * connection to be notified.
 *
 * (For very similar reasons, outgoing notifications are also not sent until
 * the transaction that sends them commits.)
 *
 * Multiple receivers on the same connection may listen on a notification of
 * the same name.  An incoming notification is processed by invoking all
 * receivers (zero or more) of the same name.
